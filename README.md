# 1. Professional Assessment

I started in the computer science program in January of 2018, and it has taken me a little over 5 years to complete my degree. I started out having little to no knowledge about computer science or anything in the IT field aside from the feeling that was what I wanted to do with my life. Throughout the course of those 5 years, I have learned how approaching a problem in different ways can lead to solving the issue, the importance of the software life cycle, how integral both software and hardware are to technology. When considering the problem, you need to look at what is available to fix it and what learn as much as you about the problem and what complications can come in solving it. When you are developing software you must plan for the expected lifetime of the software as the software isn’t always likely to be a one and done project. Complications can arise while the software is released as well and upkeeping the software for the duration of its existence.

# 2. Code Review

I used the final project from IT 145 Foundations in App Development as the artifact for this capstone project.
The code review for that artifact can be found here:

# 3. Software Design and Engineering

## Enhancements
- Converted Application from Java to C++
- Added initial delete and update functions to the application
- Moved functions from main file to classes - Main file was cluttered and it was hard to find what you were looking for
- Added constructive comments - Increased comments and made them more understandable
- Layed initial groundwork for database - Added functions that you be usable with database implementation


# 4. Algorithms and Data Structures

## Enhancements

- Secured data inputs with loops - Made functions accept only the allowed input from user
- Developed algorithms for the application - Added algorithms for the functions to work as intended along with the main menu
- Updated functions for better efficiency - Added better data structures to the functions.


# 5. Databases

## Enhancements

- Implemented SQLite database
- Update functions to ensure database security - Updated algorithms to further protect the database from improper user input
- Updated functions to allow database functionality - Adjusted the functions to interact with the database
- Removed redundant functions - Removed functions that were no longer needed or in use

# 6. Skills Demonstrated

This artifact has allowed me to showcase my understanding of the C++ language. This was my first time converting an application from one language to another. I have worked more with C++ than I have with Java. The best way to demonstrate my ability to work with C++ was to convert all the functions and then make them more efficient. I followed best standards by creating a header file to declare each function used by the application and then a cpp file that defined the functions. I made the main file of the application more organized by taking the functions for handling the data and separating them into the specific classes they needed to be apart of. Then I refined and completed each function so that they would work. When the original artifact was created we only had to implement about half of the functions. With it being my first time working on a larger project I didn’t know at the time of completion that the functions did not all work as intended even if they were implemented. I created code that would be easily reusable across all the classes and if the need arose it could be used to add new classes. The menu can still be expanded to allow for new functions for the user as well. The way that I had the code neatly organized and set up allowed my friends who reviewed my code with me during this portion of the enhancement process to easily jump in and work with me to solve some of the issues that I found in my program.

This artifact demonstrates my ability to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. First by creating a well-organized, and fully commented application that was easy for my peers to jump in and work on as well as review the code that was provided. Secondly I followed through with enhancements to create the application that was wanted by the stakeholders in the original artifact. The application now has full CRUD functionality across all 3 of the classes that were part of the artifact. Lastly by showing that I can reach out to others and work together to solve an issue I have shown that I can work in a collaborative setting.

This portion of the artifact demonstrates the ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Communication can be a little difficult for me as a way of explaining what is going on in my mind even when I’m very familiar with it. I created a video code review that I talked about the enhancements that I planned on completing as well as the things I took note of in the original artifact. While this not the greatest code review I also worked on an informal code review with my peers during the enhancement process where we went over the application through screen sharing and discussed together what we saw and where what we thought might be the cause of the issue. 

This artifact demonstrates my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. While I did not write out a pseudocode from this artifact I did break down application into segments for what needed to be completed. In each of the files of the application I wrote out what each function needed to accomplish and entail. This artifact was intended to be a menu for users to interact with a database this meant that it wasn’t intended for a single interaction. This required me to apply logic and implement it so that the menu would return after each transaction. I set up the while loop to run until the user inputs a specific value. I had a lot of plans that I wanted to implement such as user authorization into this application, but I had to set that aside until another time as my time for this was limited. 

This artifact demonstrates an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I have separated the classes into header files to declare the functions of the software while defining those same functions in the cpp files. The enhancement process for this project required a set time frame to be adhered to. The life cycle of software was used in this artifact to set a schedule for work that needed to be handled. I started out by planning out the enhancements that were needed for this application and defining everything that would be required for the application to meet those enhancements which was demonstrated in the code review. After that I designed an outline for the functions and interactions of the application before starting to build the project. The following 3 weeks I spent building the artifact based on the designs that I had. I chose an artifact to convert to another language which required me to build the application all over again. The last two weeks of this class I spent testing and getting ready for the deployment or presentation of the completed artifact. While I would have liked to had the time implement testing into the artifact I did not, instead I took the time to test each function myself every time I made an update to the application.

The skills this artifact demonstrate that I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. I programmed into the enhancements loops to prevent users from inputting data that wasn’t intended. Before the data is sent to the database all user inputs are validated so that the only values are within expectations. Keeping security in mind and having not had the chance to implement test functions into the application I went through each function and tested what I could come up with that the users might try.
